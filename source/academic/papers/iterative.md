Data exploration tools based on code can access any
data source, result in reproducible scripts and encourage users
to verify, reuse and modify existing code. Unfortunately, they are
hard to use and require expert coding skills. Can we make data
exploration tools based on code accessible to non-experts?

We present The Gamma, a novel text-based data exploration
environment that answers the question in the affirmative. The
Gamma takes the idea of code completion to the limit. Users
create transparent and reproducible scripts without writing code,
by repeatedly choosing from offered code completions.

The Gamma is motivated by the needs of data journalists and
shows that we may not need to shy away from code for building
accessible, reproducible and transparent tools that allow a broad
public to benefit from the rise of open data.
