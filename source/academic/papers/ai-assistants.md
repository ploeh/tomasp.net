Data wrangling tasks such as obtaining and linking data from various sources, transforming data
formats, and correcting erroneous records, can constitute up to 80% of typical data engineering work.
Despite the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, data wrangling remains a tedious
and manual task. We introduce _AI assistants_, a class of semi-automatic interactive tools to
streamline data wrangling. An AI assistant guides the analyst through a specific data wrangling
task by recommending a suitable data transformation that respects the constraints
obtained through interaction with the analyst.

We formally define the structure of AI assistants and describe how existing tools that
treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition.
We implement AI assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make AI assistants easily
accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook environment for data science, by leveraging
the common structure they follow. We evaluate our AI assistants both quantitatively and
qualitatively through three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes
it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully automatic tool.
