Our thinking about software is shaped by basic assumptions and metaphors that we rarely question.
Computer science has the term science in its very name; we think of programming languages as formal
mathematical objects and we hope to make better software by treating it as an engineering
discipline. Those perspectives enabled a wide range of useful developments, but I believe they have
outlived their usefulness. We need new ways of thinking about software that are able to cope with
ill-defined problems and the increasing complexity of software. In this essay, I draw a parallel
between the world of software and the world of architecture, design and urban planning. I hope to
convince the reader that this is a well-justified parallel and I point to a number of discussions
in architecture, design and urban planning from which the software world could learn. What kind of
software may we be able to build if we think of programming as a design problem and aim to create
navigable and habitable software for all its users?
