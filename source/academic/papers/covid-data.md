This paper charts responses to urgent appeals by welfare charities through crowd funding websites
in order to examine the impact of the Covid19 pandemic on public generosity and social cohesion in
the UK. It uses a relatively new method in social policy research, data-harvesting. Online public
giving to local charities for vulnerable people sky-rocketed during the crisis, despite the
long-established stigmatic treatment of the able-bodied poor of working age, a decade of benefit
cuts, the increased stringency of Universal Credit and the long-term downward trend in charity
incomes. Welfare policy and the rhetoric that surrounds it is increasingly divisive, although most
welfare spending addresses needs or risks that confront all of us. The Covid19 lockdown can be seen
as a natural experiment in social inclusion. This paper shows how policy discourse that stresses
common humanity in the face of a collective challenge, rather than social divisions, can help build
social cohesion.
