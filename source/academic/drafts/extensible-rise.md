The term extensible programming language is not something that would be familiar to programmers and computer scientists today. Yet, in the1960s and 1970s, extensible programming languages were a household name. Two symposia on extensible languages were held in 1969 and 1971; a 1974 paper author  counted 27 extensible languages proposed by 55 people; Harvard caried out an Extensible Languages Research Program and "A Survey of Extensible Programming Languages" reviewing the work in the area was published in 1974. What were extensible programming languages, where did the term go and why?
