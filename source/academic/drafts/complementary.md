Is it worth looking at the history of programming, not just for the sake of history, but in order
to discover lost ideas that could be utilized by present-day computer scientists to advance the
state of the art of programming? We answer the question in the affirmative, propose a methodology
for doing so and present an early experiment that recovers a number of interesting programming
ideas from, against all odds, Commodore 64 BASIC.
