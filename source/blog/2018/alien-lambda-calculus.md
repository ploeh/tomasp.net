Unless you are a sci-fi author or some secret government agency, the question whether aliens
would understand lambda calculus is probably not your main practical concern. However, the question
is intriguing because it nicely vividly formulates a fundamental question about our formal mathematical
knowledge. Are mathematical theories and results about them _invented_, i.e. constructed by
humans, or _discovered_, i.e. are they eternal truths that exist regardless of whether there are
humans to know them?

The question makes for a fantastic late night pub debate, but how can we go about answering it using
a more serious methodology? Is there a paper one can read to better understand the problem?
Occasionally, a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&v=IOiZatlZtGU)
or an [online comment](https://www.quora.com/Do-aliens-have-LISP-or-Scheme)
by a computer scientist comments on this question, but way too often, people miss the fact that
the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental questions of _philosophy of
mathematics_. Alas, all those discussions are carefully hidden in the humanities department!

I believe that knowing a bit about philosophy of mathematics is important if we want to have a
meaningful debate about philosophical questions of mathematics (sic!) and so I did a talk
[on this very subject at CodeMesh 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoWH2jNlvQQ).
This article is slightly refined and hopefully
more polished version of the talk for those who, like me, prefer reading over watching.
Keep in mind that the question about the nature of mathematical entities is one of the fundamental
questions of an _entire academic discipline_. As such, this article cannot possibly cover all the
relevant discussions. Compared to some other writings in this space, this article is, at least,
based on a couple of philosophical books that, I believe, have useful things to say on the subject!

Crash course in philosophy of mathematics
-----------------------------------------

Before we get to lambda calculus, I want to discuss four different ways of thinking about
mathematical theories. Again, these do not cover all the broad range of ideas that exist in
philosophy of mathematics, but they will tell us interesting things about lambda calculus
(and aliens!) later in the article.

### Platonism and eternal truths

The first idea, going back to Plato, is that _the existence of mathematical objects is
independent of us, our language, thoughts and practices._ In other words, mathematical theories
like lambda calculus and theorems exist independently of humans and will continue to exist
when all humans (and their textbooks!) are gone. They have an independent existence and we can,
through some mechanism discover them.

This is an appealing view. If you follow simple logical steps to derive an idea from basic
axioms, it feels that we are simply watching shadows of some true ideal derivations that are
free of all human mistakes. This is, however, just a feeling you might (or might not) have about
mathematics and there is no way to directly access this world of ideal mathematical entities.

[Lakoff and Núñez (2001)](http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb) refer to this as _The Romance of Mathematics_ and point out some of the
sad consequences. _The Romance of Mathematics makes a wonderful story, but it intimidates, it
helps to maintain an elite, it rewards incomprehensibility._ In other words, you either can
or cannot _see_ the world of eternal mathematical truths. If no, then bad luck - you probably
won't be a mathematician (or a theoretical computer scientist) and our writing is only
incomprehensible to you, because you do not see the truths in it.

### Mathematics as a social process

<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/poly.png" class="rdecor"
    style="width:40%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" />

When you read a mathematical (or a theoretical programming language) textbook, it gives a few
axioms and then proves interesting results that logically follow from the axioms. This orderly
presentation is not how mathematics is done. First, what definitions are _interesting_ is a
question that depends on the community of mathematicians. In other words, it is a social problem.
Second, it often takes some time to get the axioms right so that they cover all intended use cases
and allow all proofs that we want.

The process is beautifully documented in [Imre Lakatos' Proofs and Refutations](http://amzn.to/2GEXwl2),
which looks at the [Euler characteristic of polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic).
The polyhedra in the illustration is one of those that break the original formula (because its sides
are stars that cross, rather than triangles). To quote Lakatos:

> Mathematics does not grow through increase of the number of established theorems, but through
> improvement by speculation and criticism, by the method of _proofs and refutations_.

The social side of mathematics is particularly relevant because it helps to explain why the  
same thing often appears independently at a similar time (it answers a question that the community cares about)
and how comes that there are isomorphism between remote theories (some of them were adapted and improved to match).

### Cultural roots of mathematics

Mathematics is not shaped by social processes, but some aspects of mathematics also depend on
our human culture more generally. [Lakoff and Núñez (2001)](http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb) give a
couple of examples of how Western culture found its way into the very fabric of mathematics
that are also relevant to programming:

 * The idea of an _essence_ goes back to Aristotle. Believing that there is such essence that,
   somehow, accurately captures the nature of a thing is rooted in our culture and it is perfectly
   reasonable to imagine that other cultures might not share the concept of essence.

 * The idea of _foundations_ for a subject matter is another culturally rooted concept.
   The famous [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program) was trying
   to provide foundations for mathematics. If it was not for our culture, the program would
   likely not be interesting and influential in the community.

 * The idea that human reason is a form of logic is another idea that goes back to Aristotle.
   Any form of _reasoning_ about programs using _laws_ relies on this cultural fabric of mathematics.

### Theory of embodied mathematics

The book that had the most influence on my talk about aliens and lambda calculus is
[Where Mathematics Comes From](http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb) by Lakoff and Núñez. The key idea is that
_"The only mathematics we know or can know is a brain-and-mind-based mathematics."_ In other words,
if we want to understand the nature of mathematics, we need to look at how it happens in the brain.
Of course, we are very far from understanding how the brain works, but cognitive sciences have
some interesting results that we can rely on.

This has some important consequences. In particular, the question whether mathematical ideas
exists as an independent eternal entities is more a religious question than a scientific one.
If they exist and are truly independent, then we have no way of accessing them and all we can
do is to believe. In contrast, the theory of embodied mathematics has some concrete scientific
methods that we can use to study the nature of mathematics - and perhaps also the nature of
programming language theories!

Cognitive science of mathematics
--------------------------------

<a href="http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/where.jpg" class="rdecor"
  style="width:40%;max-width:400px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" /></a>

The work on embodied mathematics also tells us interesting things about programming language
theory. Moreover, it can be almost directly applied to the question of aliens and lambda calculus,
because the central point is that our human brain-and-mind mathematics relies on our human
brain-and-mind perception of the world. How would aliens perceive the world and what are the
conditions under which they would be likely to develop ideas such as the lambda calculus?

### Understanding mathematics through metaphors

The central idea of the theory of embodied mathematics is that _metaphors_ are not just a
literary device, but the key to understanding of our thinking. The authors cite results from
cognitive science research showing that abstract concepts are understood, via metaphors,
in terms of more concrete concepts. In particular:

> Many mathematical ideas are ways of mathematicizing ordinary ideas,
> as when derivatives mathematicize the idea of instantaneous change.

Understanding the derivatives is one thing, but how does one understand more abstract
mathematical concepts such as predicate logic, monoids or the lambda calculus? The understanding
is constructed using the following components:

 * **Innate arithmetic.** We are born with some very basic mathematical capabilities.
   In an experiment on 6 month babies (see image below), researchers remove one toy behind
   a curtain and measure how long the babies look at the result - they look longer if the
   unexpected thing happens (because a toy is secretly put back behind a curtain). This
   suggests that we are capable of basic addition and subtraction of small numbers.

 * **Conceptual metaphors.** Basic metaphors link different concepts via neural conflation.
   For example, our innate arithmetic capability of counting to three is linked with real-world
   ideas such as collections of objects or movement following a line. This allows us to extend
   the concept of number from just three to numbers appearing in the nature.

 * **Layering metaphors.** Finally, more abstract mathematical concepts are constructed using
   layering metaphors that link between multiple metaphorically constructed ideas. This is how
   we can go, for example, from a number series to a more abstract structure such as a monoid.

<img src="mickey.png" style="width:100%" />

### How is arithmetic constructed?

How can we discover those metaphors? One way (cheaper than monitoring the brain activity)
is to look at the language we use for talking about abstract mathematical entities and
real-world entities they arise from. For example, I mentioned that arithmetic can be explained
via a metaphor as a collection of objects.

<img src="objects.png" class="rdecor" style="max-width:600px" />

When we say _"add onions and carrots to the soup"_, we are using the word _add_ for working
with object collection (things in a soup) and it happens to be the same word we use for addition.
This is a metaphorical link! We sometimes say _"7 is bigger than 5"_ rather than _greater_
(even though they are the same size on your screen), because we think of those numbers as
collections of objects.

The table from [Lakoff and Núñez (2001)](http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb) illustrates the metaphor.
This allows us to create abstract concepts in terms of concrete things that we interact with
in the world. Interestingly, the metaphors also give rise to laws. For example, if you have
an object collection (soup) and first add onions before adding carrots, it is the same as if
you add carrots, before adding onions. This physical property of object collection explains
the symmetry of addition. Of course, the metaphors have limits - for example, collection with
no objects in it is not really a collection, so this metaphor does not explain zero very well,
but there are other metaphors which do.

Lambda calculus is discovered, Angular is invented
--------------------------------------------------

Saying that something is discovered suggests that it has a profound structure that would
exist without any humans. As discussed before, this is essentially a belief in Platonism.
On the other hand, saying that something is invented suggests that the entity is not
one of those eternal truths that a Platonist believes in.

Philip Wadler made a remark [in one of his talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R&v=IOiZatlZtGU)
that lambda calculus and functional languages are discovered while other programming
languages are invented (which is why aliens would understand lambda calculus, but not C).
How do we know that lambda calculus is discovered? The strongest argument is that the same structure
appeared independently in logic, computation and category theory. This is known as the
[Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence)
and I'll say a few words about it before discussing a number of philosophical arguments against this idea.

### Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence

The idea behind the [Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence)
is that there are corresponding structures in lambda calculus, logic and category theory. This is
useful in many ways - for example, you can take ideas from logic and turn them into type system
features. As a brief example:

$$$
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\textsf{PROGRAMS} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{LOGIC} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{CATEGORIES}\\
\textsf{type} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{formula} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{object}\\
\textsf{function} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{implication} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{arrow}\\
\textsf{tuple} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{conjunction} & \Longleftrightarrow & \textsf{product}\\
\end{array}

Types in lambda calculus correspond to logical formulas and objects in category theory.
For example, a tuple $A \times B$ (which contains values of both $A$ and $B$) corresponds to a
formula $A \,\&\, B$ (which is true when both $A$ and $B$ are true) and can be modelled as
categorical product. A function $A \rightarrow B$ matches logical implication $A \rightarrow B$.
If we have a value $A$, we can call the function and get a value $B$. If you have a proof of $A$
and a proof of $A \rightarrow B$, you can use the [Modus ponens rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)
to derive a proof of $B$.

I hope you can see why many people find this elegant! Even without understanding all the details,
you can see that the structures are similar - you can see that simply from the fact that I
can describe corresponding concepts using sentences of a very similar structure. So, why do
I have objections against the idea that lambda calculus (and logic and category theory)
are discovered?

### Philosopher's take: Category mistakes

<a href="http://amzn.to/2BTAuYw"><img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/alien-lambda-calculus/mechanizing.jpg" class="rdecor"
  style="width:35%;max-width:300px;margin-left:30px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" /></a>

First of all, even if the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence had no problems, it talks about
_mathematical entities_. Programming language theoreticians use lambda calculus as a formal model
of computation, but that does not make it a _programming language_. A programming language is
a technical artifact with a compiler (which can have bugs) while formal models are (if we are
Platonist) eternal and ideal.

[James Fetzer calls](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=48530) this problem a _category mistake_.
He argues that this is why you cannot formally verify a program - because formal proof is a
different kind of thing than a computer program. This philosophical analysis upset a number
of people working on program verification and you can read the history in Donald MacKenzie's
[Mechanizing Proof book](http://amzn.to/2BTAuYw). In our case, this means that even if lambda
calculus was discovered, all programming languages including the most elegant functional
languages are invented.

### Sociologist's take: Communities and processes

If we consider how the social process of mathematics contributes to the Curry-Howard-Lambek
correspondence, it becomes less magical. First, I mentioned [Imre Lakatos' Proofs and Refutations](http://amzn.to/2GEXwl2)
earlier. The idea is that mathematical theorems develop and improve over time in order to
deal with problematic counter-examples or other new contexts. Could this be the case here?
The correspondence is between very specific kinds of theories - you need, _simply typed_ lambda
calculus, _intuitionistic_ logic and _cartesian closed_ categories. This does not make it
any less interesting useful, but it shows that the correspondence is a result carefully constructed
by mathematicians. And our ambition to unify disjoint branches of mathematics that made this
work possible is likely a product of our human culture.

There is one more way in which the social process of mathematics contributed to the
correspondence. The work on both (modern) formal logic and lambda calculus is a response
to [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program) aiming to provide
foundations of mathematics. In other words, intuitionistic logic and lambda calculus both
developed from the same community, solving the same problem - and so it is not all that
surprising that they share notable structural similarities.

### Cognitive scientist's take: Embodied experience

Finally, the cognitive science explanation of the correspondence between the three is that
they arise from the same embodied experience. Lambda calculus, category theory and
logic are abstractions constructed via layering metaphors, based on our experience of
living in the physical world. The fact that the three can be linked to each other (through
another layering metaphor) follows from the fact that they are largely based on the same
embodied experience. What physical experience do we need to construct the lambda calculus?

## Where lambda calculus comes from
[Lakoff and Núñez (2001)](http://amzn.to/2FEu0eb) uses the cognitive science framework to
explain a number of mathematical ideas including set theory, logic, trigonometric functions
and logarithms, but sadly, it does not include the lambda calculus. In this section, I will
try to use some of the methods that Lakoff and Núñez introduce to think about lambda calculus,
but this is only a sketch to give you an idea how this reasoning might look like.

### Container schema
There are at least two fundamental physical experiences that are necessary for the development
of the lambda calculus using cognitive metaphors. The first one is the container schema. This is
a real-world analogy that lets us construct the set theory and the
[Modus ponens rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens).

If you have a small black object, put it in a glass and then put the glass in a large jug, the
small black object will also be in the jug. This is a real world experience analogous to the
idea that if you have an object $x$ which is a member of a set $A$, then if $A$ is a subset of
$B$, then $x$ is also a member of $B$.

<img src="container.png" style="max-width:600px;margin:0px auto 20px auto;width:100%"/>

More formally, if $x\in A$ and $A \subseteq B$ then also $x\in B$. Now, if we think of types as
sets (which is a frequently used linking metaphor that people use when thinking about types),
we can see how the container schema relates to the typing rule for the function application.
The structure is very similar. If $x:A$ and $f:A\rightarrow B$ then $f(a):B$. Having a type is
like being a set member and subset relation is like function application.

The key idea is that, even something very abstract as the $\beta$-reduction rule in lambda
calculus is derived, through a series of linking metaphors, from our bodily experience.
My explanation using container schema is one attempt - perhaps not perfect - but
it follows the general method outlined by Lakoff and Núñez.

### Directionality
The reason why explaining lambda calculus in terms of the container schema matters is that
it places requirements on what the alien world needs to have in order for the aliens to
be able to conceive it. I will get to this when discussing concrete aliens in the next section.
Now, there is one more requirement that we can discover through cognitive science methods.

One way of finding metaphors we use is to look at the language we use for talking about
mathematical concepts. For example, why is the $\beta$-reduction (application) rule called
_reduction_? If you look at the [dictionary definition of
'reduce'](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reduce), you'll find that reduce means:

 1. _to bring down_ to a smaller extent, size, amount
 2. _to lower in degree_, intensity, etc.
 3. _to bring down_ to a lower rank, dignity, etc.

The interesting aspect shared by all these explanations is that they require a sense of
directionality. Reduction is a transformation from something larger towards something smaller.
Again, this is something that needs to exist in our physical world, otherwise we would likely
not be able to construct the lambda calculus!

## Would aliens understand lambda calculus?
I used the question whether aliens would understand lambda calculus as a starting point for
a discussion about several directions in philosophy of mathematics and the fundamental question
of the nature of mathematical concepts. Now that I've done that, it's time to get back to
aliens.

Would aliens understand lambda calculus? The answer is that it depends on the aliens.
Human-like aliens living in human-like world have a very good chance of coming up with similar
ideas, although even they might lack the necessary cultural concepts such as _essence_ and
_foundations_ that led human mathematicians to the lambda calculus. However, more interesting
aliens might have problems. Let's wrap up with three concrete examples.

#### Heptapods from Arrival

<img src="solaris.jpg" class="rdecor" style="width:60%;max-width:300px" />

First concrete aliens we can think about are heptapods from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)">Arrival movie</a>
(based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life">Story of Your Life</a>, which is
still on my reading list...). The aliens in the movie have a language that has a circular nature.
The movie plot relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a>
that language shapes your thinking and your understanding of the world. I can avoid spoilers by
saying that this means that heptapods would probably not have the notion of _directionality_ that
is needed for the $\beta$-reduction rule. What does this mean? Perhaps heptapods would only
be able to understand reversible computations, but not the lambda calculus!

#### The planet from Lem's Solaris
Even more extreme example of an alient that might not understand the lambda calculus appears in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)">Solaris novel</a> by Stanislaw Lem. To discuss
this one, I will need to reveal a bit more, so skip this section if you want to read it!
Solaris is a planet covered by an ocean that is a single sentient being.

Would a single planet-scale alien understand lambda calculus? It is quite conceivable that
it would lack much more from our mathematics than just the lambda calculus! Given that
the ocean from Solaris is just a single being known to it, it might very well only have the
number one!

#### Aliens in a gaseous universe
I don't have a literary reference for my last example (after the talk, a friend recommended
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)">Blindsight</a> which is also on my reading list).
But imagine alien civilization that lives in a gaseous planet as a swarm. Given the chaotic
nature of the atmosphere, such aliens would be able to easily navigate through chaotic environment
that is completely unpredictable for us.

However, they might lack many things that are completely obvious to us, such as the container
schema. In a chaotic environment on the gaseous planet, there are no discrete boundaries and
there is no inside or outside. Similarly, the structure of the mathematics that the gaseous aliens
can create would be very different from ours and would hardly include the lambda calculus.

## Conclusions
The main point of this blog post was not to argue which aliens would understand lambda calculus
and which would not. Instead, my goal is to introduce some of the ideas from _philosophy of
mathematics_ that we can use to argue about the nature of mathematical and computer science
entities in a more informed manner.

The naive argument that computer scientists often make is that lambda calculus is at the heart
of the isomorphism between logic, computation and category theory and this suggests that it
refers to some eternal truth. This is a Platonist view of mathematics which is just one of
several positions. The main problem with it is that it cannot be tested and so it is more
a religious belief than a scientific claim. However, it also ignores the social, cognitive and
cultural aspects of mathematical knowledge.

I believe that a more useful way of thinking about mathematical and theoretical computer science
entities is to see them as the product of our embodied mind, influenced by the social processes
that surround mathematics and, partly, rooted in our cultural heritage.
If we think about mathematics this way, we can then find a number of problems that aliens
might have when trying to understand the lambda calculus. Especially if we think a bit more
creatively about the world in which the aliens might live, or consider some concrete aliens from
a good sci-fi book or a movie.
